183: new api link

186: old final_net join code wasn't working so I adjusted it

local_morans

239: column name n_lamps doesn't appear in final_nets, replaced with count_posts

245: moran.plot to get the hot/cold spot quadrants

257: added a case_when call to get hot/cold/neither instead of just hot spots

car_theft_23

419: added in police_grid geometries to get burg_KDE_sf to work
